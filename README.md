## Usage

* Start typing to search with Google. Suggestions will be provided by DuckDuckGo and from you history.
* Entering a shortcut key and Enter will redirect to the configured site.
  Example: `r` redirects to [reddit.com]
* Entering a shortcut key followed by a `:` allows searching on the configured site.

* Entering a shortcut key followed by a path will redirect directly to that path.

* Entering a full URL will redirect directly to that URL.
* Type `invert!` for inverted colors.
* Configure your sites in the CONFIG part of the html, you can change the shortcut key, background color and configure the search URL.
#### You can add default suggestions for shortcut keys and change settings like:

## Versions

* [legacy.html](/legacy.html) and therefor [link/legacy.html](https://clinqkhome.now.sh/legacy.html) feature the old page that loads a lot faster.
